# ChP-C-QA-Dataset
QA research in Chinese painting and calligraphy (ChP&C) lacks dedicated evaluation datasets, limiting system development. To address this, we construct a domain-specific QA dataset. Questions and KoPL programs are first generated via template sampling, then rewritten with LLMs to produce diverse, natural expressions. The dataset includes KoPL programs, LLM-rewritten questions, and answers.

It covers seven question types, including multi-hop reasoning, comparative judgment, and factual verification, spanning varying difficulty from simple attribute queries to multi-hop inference. This design evaluates system generalization and performance across cognitive complexity. Questions encompass diverse content, such as historical periods, painters, techniques, and artworks, reflecting both the structure of the ChP&C knowledge graph and practical QA demands, providing a comprehensive resource for system evaluation in this domain.
